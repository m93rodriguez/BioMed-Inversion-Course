# Modelling_BioMed_Course


## Description

This repository contains material for the couse of Biomedical Modelling and Inverse Problems
for the MscT in Complex Systems Engineering - Biomedical Engineering.

This is a work in progress. The Documents directory contains instructions for the Practical Work sessions, the slides for the couses, and other material for the more curious. 

The Scripts directory contains sample code in Python, that can be used during the practical sessions, or as examples.

## Use of the scripts

The use of a virtual environment is recommended. Install the requirements with pip.
For now, you can place the scripts in your working directory and import the modules as needed. In the future, they might be callable as a package.
